## Soccer
---
Soccer has been a part of my life since the beginning, I played soccer all the way from when I started walking to senior year of highschool. I decided not to continue playing soccer in college which was a tough decision but it was the right call. As i play soccer with friends now, it makes me wish i played in college sometimes but regardless it is still the same sport I love! I love to watch the sport as well. I am a very big fan of Lionel Messi pictured below. He is easily the greatest soccer player to ever touch the ball. I Hope I get to watch a game in person one day.

## Information Technology

As I mentioned previously I am an IT student at the University of Missouri - Columbia. I decided to go this route because i found it the most interesting to me and I really enjoy what ive been learning and the projects i've created. My father works in the cyber security area so that also really influenced my decision and also intend to look more into cyber security and software engineering as well.
